**User questions:** The best way to get help is to post your question to a site
like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=openms), with
thousands of users available to answer.  Smaller alternatives include
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/openms/openms). We wish we could keep an eye on
these sites, or answer questions directly, but the volume is just a little
overwhelming!

**Development issues:** For OpenMS development-related matters (e.g. bug reports), please
see [Community](/community).

### [OpenMS mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/openms-discussion)

This list is the main forum for longer-form discussions, like adding new features to openms, making changes to the OpenMS Roadmap, and all kinds of project-wide decision making.

Announcements about openms, such as for releases, developer meetings, sprints or
conference talks are also made on this list.

On this list please use bottom posting, reply to the list (rather than to
another sender), and don't reply to digests. A searchable archive of this list
is available [here](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/open-ms-general/).

### [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/openms/openms/issues)

- For bug reports;

- and feature requests (e.g. "I would like to have a new interpolation method in `spectrum.sortByPosition()`").
