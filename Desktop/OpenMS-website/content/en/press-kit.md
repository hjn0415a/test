We would like to make it easy for you to include the OpenMS project identity in your next academic paper, course materials, or presentation. 

You will find several high-resolution versions of the OpenMS logo [here](https://github.com/OpenMS/images). Note that by using the openms.org resources, you accept the [OpenMS Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).
