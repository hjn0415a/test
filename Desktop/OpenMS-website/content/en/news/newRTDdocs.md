The OpenMS team is proud to present a new OpenMS manual at openms.readthedocs.io. This manual provides much more detail about mass spectrometry including links to relevant sections of University of Tübingen video lectures and a glossary. It also provides more detail about installing OpenMS and it includes the pdf tutorial that was used in classroom presentations of OpenMS. Creation of the manual was supported by grants from Google Season of Docs, from the University of Tübingen and from the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative Diversity&Inclusion program.
