The OpenMS developers meeting brings bioinformaticians working in computational mass spectrometry together to shape the future development of OpenMS. It is targeted to core developers, new developers, and potential future contributors. Short talks, developer tutorials, and code sprints will be intertwined. Participants will have the opportunity to design custom tools and workflows together with instructors. External users are welcome to bring their own ideas and will receive detailed feedback as well as help getting started in OpenMS development. Progress will be tracked on our GitHub page with a resume of each day.
