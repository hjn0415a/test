OpenMS is a flexible codebase that can be tailored to many different applications ranging from the standard label free analysis to top down, metabolomics, crosslinking or DIA.

Choose an application of OpenMS that you are interested in. The pages will provide explanations on how OpenMS can be used to solve your problems and link to workflows that allow you to apply the tools to your data.

If you cannot find your application in the menu on the left, more OpenMS tools can be found in the [TOPP documentation](https://abibuilder.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/nightly/html/TOPP_documentation.html).
