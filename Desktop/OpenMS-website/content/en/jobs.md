{{< notice note >}}
We have several open Ph.D. / Post-Doc positions in Bioinformatics
at the Kohlbacher Group (University of Tübingen)
to work with OpenMS on cutting edge research projects.
{{< /notice >}}

If you love open science and would like to work within a large research-oriented open-source project feel free to contact us about specific project details.

In general, you will work in a multidisciplinary Applied Bioinformatics research group as part of the mass-spectrometry special interest group as part of a diverse team of developers and scientists. A large part of the group is located at the WSI for Informatics of the University of Tübingen but associations exist with the clinics and the Max-Planck-Institute.

#### Responsibilities are project dependent and may include:

- Building analysis workflows
- Maintaining OpenMS and working on releases
- Conduct own research related to mass-spectrometry by developing new tools
- Publish the results of your research and present it at international conferences
- Generic software engineering tasks (e.g. designing efficient data structures or file formats) or user interface developments to be carried out

#### Requirements

- Background in bioinformatics, computer science, computational biology or related fields
- Ideally, skilled in C++ and Git(Hub)-based version control
- Basic knowledge about mass-spectrometry with eagerness to learn
- Experience with a workflow system (e.g. KNIME, Galaxy, or nextflow) is beneficial
- Strong command of English
